    "summary": "This paper presents Cube2Pipes, a game that investigates hybrid gameplay using augmented reality (AR) and a tangible 3D puzzle. The game interface adapts to user movement and interaction with both virtual and tangible elements. A user study evaluates the game's effectiveness in comparing hybrid gameplay to standard gameplay with only virtual elements. The study also explores whether the game facilitates understanding of spatial moves required to solve a Rubik's Cube.",

SS-ADA integrates active learning into semi-supervised semantic segmentation to achieve the accuracy of supervised learning with limited labeled data from the target domain. An IoU-based class weighting strategy is also introduced to address the class imbalance problem.",

C-LAIfO leverages contrastive learning and data augmentation to achieve visually robust latent space estimation. It then uses off-policy adversarial imitation learning within this space. Experiments demonstrate C-LAIfO's effectiveness on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks.",
