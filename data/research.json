        "abstract": "We present our game, Cube2Pipes, as an attempt to investigate a unique gameplay design where we use a tangible 3D spatial puzzle, in the form of a 2X2 Rubik's Cube, as an interface to a tabletop mobile augmented reality (AR) game. The game interface adapts to user movement and interaction with both virtual and tangible elements via computer vision based tracking. This game can be seen as an instance of generic interactive hybrid systems as it involves interaction with both virtual and real, tangible elements. We present a thorough user evaluation about various aspects of the gameplay in order to answer the question as to whether hybrid gameplay involving both real and virtual interfaces and elements is more captivating and preferred by users, than standard (baseline) gameplay with only virtual elements. We use multiple industry standard user study questionnaires to try and answer this question. We also try to determine whether the game facilitates understanding of the spatial moves required to solve a Rubik's Cube, and the efficacy of a tangible puzzle interface to a tabletop AR game.",

However, there is still a lack of readily available datasets with high-quality audiovisual stimuli. In this paper, we present GameVibe, a novel affect corpus which consists of multimodal audiovisual stimuli, including in-game behavioural observations and third-person affect labels for viewer engagement. The corpus consists of videos from a diverse set of publicly available gameplay sessions across 30 games, with particular attention to ensure high-quality stimuli with good audiovisual and gameplay diversity. Furthermore, we present an analysis on the reliability of the annotators in terms of inter-annotator agreement.",

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation plays an important role in intelligent vehicles, providing pixel-level semantic information about the environment. However, the labeling budget is expensive and time-consuming when semantic segmentation model is applied to new driving scenarios. To reduce the costs, semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods have been proposed to leverage large quantities of unlabeled images. Despite this, their performance still falls short of the accuracy required for practical applications, which is typically achieved by supervised learning. A significant shortcoming is that they typically select unlabeled images for annotation randomly, neglecting the assessment of sample value for model training. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised active domain adaptation (SS-ADA) framework for semantic segmentation that employs an image-level acquisition strategy. SS-ADA integrates active learning into semi-supervised semantic segmentation to achieve the accuracy of supervised learning with a limited amount of labeled data from the target domain. Additionally, we design an IoU-based class weighting strategy to alleviate the class imbalance problem using annotations from active learning. We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic-to-real and real-to-real domain adaptation settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. SS-ADA can achieve or even surpass the accuracy of its supervised learning counterpart with only 25% of the target labeled data when using a real-time segmentation model. The code for SS-ADA is available at this https URL.",

        "time": "19 July 2024",
        "abstract": "High-quality automated poetry generation systems are currently only available for a small subset of languages. We introduce a new model for generating poetry in Czech language, based on fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model. We demonstrate that guiding the generation process by explicitly specifying strophe parameters within the poem text strongly improves the effectiveness of the model. We also find that appropriate tokenization is crucial, showing that tokenization methods based on syllables or individual characters instead of subwords prove superior in generating poetic strophes. We further enhance the results by introducing Forced generation, adding explicit specifications of meter and verse parameters at inference time based on the already generated text. We evaluate a range of setups, showing that our proposed approach achieves high accuracies in rhyming and metric aspects of formal quality of the generated poems.",

        "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the lack of tourism knowledge limits the performance of LLMs in tourist attraction presentations and travel planning. To address this challenge, we constructed a supervised fine-tuning dataset for the culture and tourism domain, named Cultour. This dataset consists of three parts: tourism knowledge base QA data, travelogues data, and tourism diversity QA data. Additionally, we propose TourLLM, a Qwen-based model supervised fine-tuned with Cultour, to improve the quality of the information provided about attractions and travel planning. To evaluate the performance of TourLLM, we employed both automatic and human evaluation, and we proposed a human evaluation criterion named CRA (Consistency, Readability, Availability). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the responses generated by the TourLLM. Our proposed Cultour is accessible at this https URL.",

We analyze the problem of imitation from expert videos with visual discrepancies, and introduce a solution for robust latent space estimation using contrastive learning and data augmentation. Provided a visually robust latent space, our algorithm performs imitation entirely within this space using off-policy adversarial imitation learning. We conduct a thorough ablation study to justify our design choices and test C-LAIfO on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how C-LAIfO can be combined with other reward signals to facilitate learning on a set of challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. Our experiments show improved performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of C-LAIfO. To ensure reproducibility, we provide open access to our code.",

        "time": "19 July 2024",
        "abstract": "Query rewrite systems perform graph substitutions using rewrite rules to generate optimal SQL query plans. Rewriting logical and physical relational query plans is proven to be an NP-hard sequential decision-making problem with a search space exponential in the number of rewrite rules. In this paper, we address the query rewrite problem by interleaving Equality Saturation and Graph Reinforcement Learning (RL). The proposed system, Aurora, rewrites relational queries by guiding Equality Saturation, a method from compiler literature to perform non-destructive graph rewriting, with a novel RL agent that embeds both the spatial structure of the query graph as well as the temporal dimension associated with the sequential construction of query plans. Our results show Graph Reinforcement Learning for non-destructive graph rewriting yields SQL plans orders of magnitude faster than existing equality saturation solvers, while also achieving competitive results against mainstream query optimisers.",
